1.  Introduction

   This document defines a DHCPv6 option to provide Network Time
   Protocol version 4 [RFC5908] or greater Server location information
   to DHCPv6 hosts.

2.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Related Work and Usage Model

   The NTP service is publicly offered on the Internet by a number of
   organizations.  Those Servers can be used but should not be abused,
   so any method which is tasked to disseminate locations of NTP Servers
   must act responsibly in a manner that does not lead to public Server
   overloading.  When using DHCPv6 to offer NTP Server location, and if
   there is a need to distribute a host with a hardcoded configuration,
   this configuration MUST NOT include Server location that is not part
   of the organization that distributes this device.  Typical usage of
   this option is to specify an NTP Server that is part of the
   organization that operates the DHCPv6 Server.

   The location of the NTP service, like any other Internet service, can
   be specified by an IP address or a Fully Qualified Domain Name
   (FQDN).  By design, DHCP offers information to multiple devices and
   is prone to amplification of mistakes, so great care must be taken to

Internet-Draft        NTP Server Option for DHCPv6        September 2013


   define its configuration.  Specification of the NTP service by FQDN
   offers a level of indirection that works as a possible mitigation
   tool in case of misconfiguration.  DNS can be used to redirect
   misconfigured clients to an IPv6 address that is not configured on
   any host instead of having to change the address of the NTP Server
   itself.

   While the NTP specification defines a comprehensive set of
   configuration parameters, modification of those parameters is best
   left to the decision of the client itself.  The DHCPv6 option for NTP
   is therefore restricted to Server location.

4.  NTP Server Option for DHCPv6

   The option carries the NTP Server or SNTP Server addresses.

   If the NTP Server or SNTP Server location is an IPv6 multicast
   address, the client SHOULD use this address as an NTP multicast group
   address and listen to messages sent to this group in order to
   synchronize its clock.

   This document does not define any priority relationship between the
   client's embedded configuration (if any) and the NTP or SNTP Servers
   discovered via this option.  In particular, the client is allowed to
   simultaneously use its own configured NTP Servers or SNTP Servers and
   the Servers discovered via DHCP.

   This option carries one or more IPv6 addresses of an NTP Server or
   SNTP Server available to the client.

   The format of the NTP Server Address option is:

      0                   1                   2                   3

5.  Issues with RFC5908

   This document obsoletes [RFC5908] and defines replacement option.
   The following list enumerates problems with RFC5908 approach:

   o  It is redundant to have 3 ways to specify the same thing.

   o  It defined 3 separate sub-options: one for unicast or anycast
      address, second for multicast address and third one for FQDN
      option.  Even though it forbade to mix them within one NTP server
      option, it allowed to send multiple instances of that option,
      effectively allowing mix and match of those types.

   o  Specifying separate option for multicast address when there is a
      unicast address option does not make sense.  It would be better to
      specify one option to send an address and allow both unicast and
      multicast in it.  It is trivial check if the received address is
      multicast (first octet is ff) or unicast (first octet is not ff).

   o  FQDN and address options have different usage models.  An address
      is consumed as is and its value does not change over time, unless
      updated information is received during renewal or rebind events.
      On the other hand, FQDN usage depends on when it is resolved.  If
      it is resolved immediately upon reception by the client, then it
      is almost equal to address (FQDN can resolve to both IPv4 and IPv6
      addresses, and can resolve to more than one address).  However,
      typical FQDN usage model is that it is stored as FQDN and later
      resolved when NTP configuration is needed.  This has the benefit
      of operator being able to change name resolution to a different
      NTP server without needing to update clients configuration.
      Please note the different timescales of receiving an address and
      receiving FQDN that is resolved many times.  Those two are
      incompatible and can't be merged easily.

   o  Client is allowed to send the NTP option (the option itself, not
      its code in ORO) in SOLICIT, REQUEST, RENEW, REBIND and
      INFORMATION-REQUEST.  The text does not explain why client may do
      that or what the server is supposed to do with received values.
      It is unclear if the client should send empty NTP option or with
      sub-options, which sub-options and with what values.

   o  It violates many DHCPv6 rules and it never completed DHC review.
      Currently the rules for defining options are specified in
      [I-D.ietf-dhc-option-guidelines].

   o  Section 7 mentioned that "the approach of only offering IPv6
      addresses to specify server location does not meet NTP
      requirements that make use of an FQDN (Fully-Qualified Domain
      Name) as well.".  However, there is no specific text in RFC5905
      about FQDN or domain names.

   o  The sub-option codes are inserted into wrong IANA registry (they
      are kept in http://www.iana.org/assignments/bootp-dhcp-parameters/
      bootp-dhcp-parameters.xhtml, while they belong to http://
      www.iana.org/assignments/dhcpv6-parameters/
      dhcpv6-parameters.xhtml).

   o  Nits: There are no server behavior or client behavior sections, so
      it is unclear what each entity is supposed to do.

6.  DHCPv6 Server Behavior

   Sections 17.2.2 and 18.2 of [RFC3315] govern server operation in
   regards to option assignment.  As a convenience to the reader, we
   mention here that the server will send option NTP Option only if
   configured with specific values for NTP Option and the client
   requested it.

7.  DHCPv6 Client Behavior

   Clients MAY request NTP Server Option, as defined in [RFC3315],
   sections 17.1.1, 18.1.1, 18.1.3, 18.1.4, 18.1.5 and 22.7.  As a
   convenience to the reader, we mention here that the client includes
   requested option codes in Option Request Option.

   Optional text (if the option contains FQDN): If the client requests
   an option that conveys an FQDN, it is expected that the contents of
   that option will be resolved using DNS.  Hence the following text may
   be useful: Clients that request option foo SHOULD also request option
   OPTION_DNS_SERVERS specified in [RFC3646].

   Clients MUST discard option foo if it is invalid (i.e. did not pass
   validation steps defined in Section X.Y).

Internet-Draft        NTP Server Option for DHCPv6        September 2013


8.  Appearance of this Option

   The OPTION_NTP_SERVER option can appear multiple times in a DHCPv6
   message.  The order in which these options appear is not significant.
   The client uses its usual algorithms to determine which Server(s) or
   multicast group(s) should be prefered to synchronize its clock.

   The OPTION_NTP_SERVER option MUST NOT appear in messages other than
   the following: Solicit, Advertise, Request, Renew, Rebind,
   Information-Request, and Reply.  If this option appears in messages
   other than those specified above, the receiver MUST ignore it.

   The option number for this option MAY appear in the "Option Request"
   option [RFC3315] in the following messages: Solicit, Request, Renew,
   Rebind, Information-Request, and Reconfigure.  If this option number
   appears in the "Option Request" option in messages other than those
   specified above, the receiver SHOULD ignore it.

9.  Security Considerations

   This option could be used by an intruder to advertise the address of
   a malicious NTP Server or SNTP Server and adversely affect the clock
   of clients on the network.  The consequences of such an attack can be
   critical, because many security protocols depend on time
   synchronization to run their algorithms.  As an example, an attacker
   could break connectivity between SEND-enabled nodes [RFC3971], simply
   by affecting the clock on these nodes.

   To prevent these attacks, it is strongly advisable to secure the use
   of this option either by:

      using the NTPv4 Autokey public key authentication, as defined in
      [RFC5906] or,

      using authenticated DHCP as described in [RFC3315] section 21.

10.  RFC 4075 Deprecation

   [RFC4075] (SNTP Configuration Option for DHCPv6) provides some degree
   of automatic time Server configuration for IPv6, as it specifies how
   to transmit SNTP [RFC4330] Servers addresses through DHCPv6.  However
   this approach is not suitable for all NTP deployments.  It is not an
   extensible mechanism and introduces some semantic confusion throught
   the use of the "SNTP" acronym.  Additionally the approach of only
   offering IPv6 addresses to specify Server location does not meet NTP
   requirements that make use of a FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name) as
   well.  For all the abovementioned reasons, this document makes
   [RFC4075] deprecated.

11.  IANA Considerations

   When this document is published, the IANA is requested to mark option
   OPTION_NTP_SERVER (56) from "DHCP Option Codes" registry as obsolete.

   TODO

   IANA is required to maintain a new number space of NTP time source
   suboptions, located in the BOOTP-DHCP Parameters Registry.  The
   initial suboptions are described in section 4 of this document.  IANA
   assigns future NTP time source suboptions with a "IETF Consensus"
   policy as described in [RFC5226].  Future proposed suboptions are to
   be referenced symbolically in the Internet-Drafts that describe them,
   and shall be assigned numeric codes by IANA when approved for
   publication as an RFC.

   Author would like to thank Richard Gayraud and Benoit Lurdelet for
   their work on RFC5908, as this document is roughly based on that
   previous work.
