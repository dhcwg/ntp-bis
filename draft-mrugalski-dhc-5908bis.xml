  <abstract>
  <t>The NTP Server Option for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
  for IPv6 (DHCPv6) provides NTP (Network Time Protocol version 4)
  Server location information to DHCPv6 hosts. This document obsoletes
  <xref target="RFC5908"/>.</t>
  </abstract>

  <section title="Introduction">
    <t>This document defines a DHCPv6 option to provide Network Time
    Protocol version 4 <xref target="RFC5908"/> or greater Server location
    information to DHCPv6 hosts. </t>
  </section>

  <section title="Requirements notation">
    <t> The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL",
    "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
    and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as
    described in <xref target="RFC2119"/>.</t>
  </section>

  <section title="Related Work and Usage Model">
    <t> The NTP service is publicly offered on the Internet by a
    number of organizations. Those Servers can be used but should not
    be abused, so any method which is tasked to disseminate locations
    of NTP Servers must act responsibly in a manner that does not lead
    to public Server overloading.  When using DHCPv6 to offer NTP
    Server location, and if there is a need to distribute a host with
    a hardcoded configuration, this configuration MUST NOT include
    Server location that is not part of the organization that
    distributes this device.  Typical usage of this option is to
    specify an NTP Server that is part of the organization that
    operates the DHCPv6 Server.
    </t>

    <t> The location of the NTP service, like any other Internet
    service, can be specified by an IP address or a Fully Qualified
    Domain Name (FQDN).  By design, DHCP offers information to
    multiple devices and is prone to amplification of mistakes, so
    great care must be taken to define its
    configuration. Specification of the NTP service by FQDN offers a
    level of indirection that works as a possible mitigation tool in
    case of misconfiguration.  DNS can be used to redirect
    misconfigured clients to an IPv6 address that is not configured on
    any host instead of having to change the address of the NTP Server
    itself.</t>
    
    <t> While the NTP specification defines a comprehensive set of
    configuration parameters, modification of those parameters is best
    left to the decision of the client itself. The DHCPv6 option for
    NTP is therefore restricted to Server location. </t>
  </section>

<section title="NTP Server Option for DHCPv6">

  <t> The option carries the NTP Server or SNTP Server FQDN.</t>

<!-- tomek: hmmm, this is interesting. The usage of unicast address (client
sends NTP request to it) and mutlicast address (client joins that multicast
group to listen on incoming messages) are different. -->
<t> If the NTP Server or SNTP Server location is an IPv6 multicast address,
    the client SHOULD use this address as an NTP multicast
    group address and listen to messages sent to this group in
    order to synchronize its clock. </t>

<section title="Issues with RFC5908">

  <t>This document obsoletes <xref target="RFC5908"/> and defines
  replacement option. The following list enumerates problems with
  RFC5908 approach:</t>

  <t>
  <list style="symbols">
    <t>It is redundant to have 3 ways to specify the same thing.</t>
    <t>It defined 3 separate sub-options: one for unicast or anycast
    address, second for multicast address and third one for FQDN
    option. Even though it forbade to mix them within one NTP server
    option, it allowed to send multiple instances of that option,
    effectively allowing mix and match of those types.</t>
    <t>Specifying separate option for multicast address when there is
    a unicast address option does not make sense. It would be better
    to specify one option to send an address and allow both unicast
    and multicast in it. It is trivial check if the received address
    is multicast (first octet is ff) or unicast (first octet is not
    ff).</t>
    <t>FQDN and address options have different usage models. An
    address is consumed as is and its value does not change over time,
    unless updated information is received during renewal or rebind
    events. On the other hand, FQDN usage depends on when it is
    resolved. If it is resolved immediately upon reception by the
    client, then it is almost equal to address (FQDN can resolve to
    both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, and can resolve to more than one
    address). However, typical FQDN usage model is that it is stored
    as FQDN and later resolved when NTP configuration is needed. This
    has the benefit of operator being able to change name resolution
    to a different NTP server without needing to update clients
    configuration. Please note the different timescales of receiving
    an address and receiving FQDN that is resolved many times. Those
    two are incompatible and can't be merged easily.</t>
    <t>Client is allowed to send the NTP option (the option itself,
    not its code in ORO) in SOLICIT, REQUEST, RENEW, REBIND and
    INFORMATION-REQUEST. The text does not explain why client may do
    that or what the server is supposed to do with received values. It
    is unclear if the client should send empty NTP option or with
    sub-options, which sub-options and with what values.</t>
    <t>It violates many DHCPv6 rules and it never completed DHC
    review. Currently the rules for defining options are specified in
    <xref target="I-D.ietf-dhc-option-guidelines"/>.</t>
    <t>Nits: There are no server behavior or client behavior sections,
    so it is unclear what each entity is supposed to do.</t>
  </list>
  </t>

</section>

<section anchor="server-behaviour" title="DHCPv6 Server Behavior">
  <t>Sections 17.2.2 and 18.2 of <xref target="RFC3315"></xref> govern
  server operation in regards to option assignment. As a convenience
  to the reader, we mention here that the server will send option NTP
  Option only if configured with specific values for NTP Option and
  the client requested it.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="client-behaviour" title="DHCPv6 Client Behavior">
  <t>Clients MAY request NTP Server Option, as defined in <xref
  target="RFC3315"></xref>, sections 17.1.1, 18.1.1, 18.1.3, 18.1.4,
  18.1.5 and 22.7. As a convenience to the reader, we mention here that
  the client includes requested option codes in Option Request
  Option.</t>

  <!-- tomek: template copied over from option-guidelines -->
  <t>Optional text (if the option contains FQDN): If the client requests
  an option that conveys an FQDN, it is expected that the contents of
  that option will be resolved using DNS. Hence the following text may
  be useful: Clients that request option foo SHOULD also request option
  OPTION_DNS_SERVERS specified in <xref target="RFC3646"></xref>.</t>

  <t>Clients MUST discard option foo if it is invalid (i.e. did not pass
  validation steps defined in Section X.Y).</t>
</section>

<section title="Appearance of this Option">

<t> The OPTION_NTP_SERVER option can appear multiple times in a
    DHCPv6 message. The order in which these options appear is not
    significant. The client uses its usual algorithms to determine
    which Server(s) or multicast group(s) should be prefered to
    synchronize its clock.</t>

<t> The OPTION_NTP_SERVER option MUST NOT appear in messages other
    than the following: Solicit, Advertise, Request, Renew, Rebind,
    Information-Request, and Reply. If this option appears in
    messages other than those specified above, the receiver MUST
    ignore it.</t>

<t> The option number for this option MAY appear in the "Option
    Request" option <xref target="RFC3315"/> in the following
    messages: Solicit, Request, Renew, Rebind, Information-Request,
    and Reconfigure. If this option number appears in the
    "Option Request" option in messages other than those specified
    above, the receiver SHOULD ignore it.</t>

</section>

<section title="Security Considerations">

  <t>This option could be used by an intruder to advertise the address
  of a malicious NTP Server or SNTP Server and adversely affect the
  clock of clients on the network. The consequences of such an attack
  can be critical, because many security protocols depend on time
  synchronization to run their algorithms.  As an example, an attacker
  could break connectivity between SEND-enabled nodes <xref
  target="RFC3971"/>, simply by affecting the clock on these
  nodes.</t>

  <t> To prevent these attacks, it is strongly advisable to
  secure the use of this option either by: </t>

  <t>
  <list>
    <t>using the NTPv4 Autokey public key authentication, as defined
    in <xref target="RFC5906"/> or,</t>

    <t>using authenticated DHCP as described in <xref
    target="RFC3315"/> section 21.</t>
  </list>
  </t>

</section>


<section title="RFC 4075 Deprecation">

<t> <xref target="RFC4075"/> (SNTP Configuration Option for DHCPv6)
    provides some degree of automatic time Server configuration
    for IPv6, as it specifies how to transmit SNTP
    <xref target="RFC4330"/> Servers addresses through DHCPv6. However
    this approach is not suitable for all NTP
    deployments. It is not an extensible mechanism and introduces
    some semantic confusion throught the use of the "SNTP" acronym.
    Additionally the approach of only offering IPv6
    addresses to specify Server location does not meet NTP requirements
    that make use of a FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name) as well.
    For all the abovementioned reasons,
    this document makes <xref target="RFC4075"/> deprecated.</t>

</section>


<section title="IANA Considerations">

  <t> When this document is published, the IANA is requested to mark
  option OPTION_NTP_SERVER (56) from "DHCP Option Codes" registry
  as obsolete.</t>

  <t>TODO</t>

  <t> IANA is required to maintain a new number space of NTP time source
  suboptions, located in the BOOTP-DHCP Parameters Registry. The
  initial suboptions are described in section 4 of this document.

  IANA assigns future NTP time source suboptions with a "IETF
  Consensus" policy as described in [RFC5226]. Future proposed
  suboptions are to be referenced symbolically in the Internet-Drafts
  that describe them, and shall be assigned numeric codes by IANA when
  approved for publication as an RFC.</t>

  <t>Author would like to thank Richard Gayraud and Benoit Lurdelet
  for their work on RFC5908, as this document is roughly based on that
  previous work.</t>
